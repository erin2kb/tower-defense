					<dd>
						The point of the game is to prevent the spiders from reaching the left side of the screen.
						<br>
						You can kill spiders by attacking them with your spear, and by building towers that shoot lasers.
						<br>
						Towers cost resources ("dream energy") to build initially, but will gradually replenish your resources over time.
					</dd>
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div class="highlight">
				<dt><b>Hero Controls</b></dt>
					<dd>To move your character, use the arrow keys. To attack, line up your spear with an enemy and press Spacebar.</dd>
				</div>
				<br><br>
				<div class="highlight">
				<dt><b>Tower Controls</b></dt>
					<dd>
						To select which type of tower to build, click the corresponding button from the menu on the left. Certain towers are better against certain enemies.
						<br>
						To build towers, click on the spot where you would like to build. If you have enough dream energy, the tower will be built. Note that you cannot build somewhere that would cause the tower to overlap an enemy, another tower, or your character.
					</dd>

					<dd>To pause the game, press P on the keyboard.</dd>
