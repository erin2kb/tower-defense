					<dd><p>The students tease each other about their various bug-related phobias. Later that night, they find themselves trapped in a shared dream world. If they ever hope to wake up again, they must manipulate positive dream energy and fight their fears to prevent the dream from becoming a permanent nightmare.</p></dd>

					<dd>
						<p>This game is strongly influenced by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies" target="_blank">Plants vs. Zombies</a>, and my goal is to give it a similar look and feel. It is 2D, the tower building is grid-based, and the player must protect the left side of the screen against the enemies who approach from the right.</p>
						<p>The player stores up a resource called "dream energy" and spends it to build towers called "dream crystals", which shoot lasers at enemies and also slowly generate dream energy.</p>
						<p>Enemies are manifestations of "nightmare energy", in the form of giant bugs. They will single-mindedly advance, converting the dream into a nightmare as they progress.</p>
						<p>In the dream world, the heroes possess armor and weapons. This enables them to move around the battlefield and assist their towers by attacking enemies themselves.</p>
